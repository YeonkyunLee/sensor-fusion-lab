**Kalman-filter state estimation for robotics — from a DSP engineer's angle.**

Estimation theory is where signal processing meets robotics. A Kalman filter is,
in DSP terms, a *time-varying optimal IIR filter* whose bandwidth adapts to the
ratio of process to measurement noise. This lab builds it from scratch and shows
where it wins — and where it doesn't.

## Experiments

### 1. Tracking a maneuvering target (`scripts/01_tracking.py`)
Constant-velocity Kalman filter recovers a curved 2D trajectory from noisy
position measurements.

| method | position RMSE | notes |
|--------|--------------:|-------|
| raw measurement | 2.69 m | — |
| moving average (w=7) | 1.01 m | position only |
| **Kalman filter** | 1.26 m | **+ velocity estimate** |

Honest result: for *dense position-only* data, a tuned moving average is
competitive. The KF's real value is state estimation (velocity, drift-free) and
**multi-sensor fusion** — shown next. Also note the tuning lesson: process noise
`q` had to be raised (0.2 → 10) so the constant-velocity model could track a
target that actually accelerates.

### 2. Position + IMU fusion with sensor outage (`scripts/02_imu_fusion.py`)
Constant-acceleration model fuses a noisy position sensor (GPS-like) with an IMU
(acceleration). Midway, the position sensor drops out for 6 s.

| method | RMSE (all) | RMSE (during outage) |
|--------|-----------:|---------------------:|
| position sensor | 2.69 m | — |
| IMU alone (dead-reckoning) | 167 m | 143 m |
| **Kalman fusion** | **1.23 m** | **2.31 m** |

The canonical result: **fusion beats every single sensor**, and coasts through
the position outage on the IMU (dead-reckoning) while IMU-alone drifts
catastrophically from double integration.

## Why this bridges to robotics (and my background)
- **DSP → estimation**: the KF is optimal linear filtering — the same innovation /
  gain / covariance machinery, now in state space.
- **Embedded → real-time**: the filter is a handful of small matrix ops per step,
  trivially real-time on an MCU.
- Next: nonlinear (EKF/UKF), IMU bias estimation, then ROS2 integration.
